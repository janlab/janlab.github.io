I"<p>Dr. An is an Assistant Professor at the Korean University in the Department of Biosystem and Biomedical Science, the School of Health Science.</p>

<p>He trained as a bioinformatician with a particular focus on human genomics and neuroscience. His PhD project involved in National Autism Research Project - <a href="http://www.autismcrc.com.au/">The Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism</a> - for the genomic sequencing project of Australian Autism families (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/tp201438">An et al. (2014)</a>).</p>

<p>During the postdoctoral training with <a href="https://sanderslab.github.io/team/stephansanders">Dr. Stephan Sanders at UCSF</a>, he worked on the analysis of whole genome sequencing data for the discovery of noncoding loci in ASD (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0107-y">An et al. (2018)</a>, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6420/eaat6576.long">Werling et al. (2018)</a>). Working with numerous collaborators, he played an integral role in developing a framework to identify high-confidence de novo and rare inherited variant from whole genome sequencing data and performing a rigorous association test to identify ASD associated noncoding loci.â€‹</p>

<p>As a PI, Dr. An leads the team studying the etiology of developmental disorders through the discovery of genetic risk factors. The team is working on the analysis of whole exome and genome sequencing data to identify de novo and noncoding mutations associated with developmental and neurological disorders.</p>
