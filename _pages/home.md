# Welcome to An Lab at the Korea University

We are a computational genomics lab  studying the etiology of developmental disorders through the discovery of genetic risk factors. We focus on:

- Understanding noncoding mutations associated with developmental and neurological disorders using high-dimensional genomic data.
- Leveraging single cell RNA sequencing to understand neurodevelopment and disorders.
- Integrating epigenome and transcriptome data to better understand genetic heterogeneity in human disorders.


### Technologies and methods
The An Lab is primarily a computational biology group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including: **whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing, epigenome sequencing, and cloud computing**.

### Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including the [Sanders Lab](http://sanderslab.ucsf.edu) at UCSF, the [Cristino Lab](https://www.tri.edu.au/staff/alex-cristino) at Translational Research Institute, Australia, and the [Autism Sequencing Consortium](https://genome.emory.edu/ASC/).
