<p>We are a computational genomics lab  studying the etiology of developmental disorders and complex human diseases through the discovery of genetic risk factors. We focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding noncoding mutations associated with developmental and neurological disorders using high-dimensional genomic data.</li>
  <li>Leveraging single cell RNA sequencing to understand neurodevelopment and disorders.</li>
  <li>Integrating epigenome and transcriptome data to better understand genetic heterogeneity in human disorders.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technologies-and-methods">Technologies and methods</h3>
<p>The An Lab is primarily a computational biology group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including: <strong>whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing, epigenome sequencing, and cloud computing</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h3>
<p>We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including the <a href="http://sanderslab.ucsf.edu">Sanders Lab</a> at UCSF, the <a href="https://www.tri.edu.au/staff/alex-cristino">Cristino Lab</a> at Translational Research Institute, Australia, and the <a href="https://genome.emory.edu/ASC/">Autism Sequencing Consortium</a>.</p>
